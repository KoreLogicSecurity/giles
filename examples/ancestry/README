OVERVIEW

  This example illustrates a simple production system with a recursive
  rule. The rule infers ancestor-descendant relationships.

  Note that this engine can rapidly grow the size of the database for
  deep hierarchies.

COMPILING THE ENGINE

  After installing Giles, this engine can be compiled using the following
  command:

    $ giles -c -o ancestry.sql ancestry.yml

  Note the use of the '-c' flag, indicating that the user knows that a
  cycle exists in the rule set.

LOADING THE ENGINE

  The engine can be loaded into a SQLite instance with the following commands:

    $ sqlite3
    sqlite> PRAGMA recursive_triggers = ON; /* If necessary. */
    sqlite> PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON; /* If necessary. */
    sqlite> .read ancestry.sql

USING THE ENGINE

  This engine describes a single class of facts, called 'IsAncestor'.
  This describes an ancestor-descendant relationship.

  Asserting known ancestor-descendant relationships will build up a
  working fact set:

    INSERT INTO Giles_IsAncestor_Facts(Ancestor, Descendant) VALUES('Betsy', 'James');
    INSERT INTO Giles_IsAncestor_Facts(Ancestor, Descendant) VALUES('Betsy', 'Marvin');
    INSERT INTO Giles_IsAncestor_Facts(Ancestor, Descendant) VALUES('Rob', 'James');
    INSERT INTO Giles_IsAncestor_Facts(Ancestor, Descendant) VALUES('Rob', 'Marvin');
    INSERT INTO Giles_IsAncestor_Facts(Ancestor, Descendant) VALUES('Julie', 'Betsy');
    INSERT INTO Giles_IsAncestor_Facts(Ancestor, Descendant) VALUES('Bob', 'Betsy');
    INSERT INTO Giles_IsAncestor_Facts(Ancestor, Descendant) VALUES('Ann', 'Rob');
    INSERT INTO Giles_IsAncestor_Facts(Ancestor, Descendant) VALUES('Jim', 'Rob');

  These statements are also available in the input.sql file that can be read
  directly by sqlite.

  The engine will automatically infer the ancestor-descendant relationship for
  all known people:

    SELECT Ancestor AS Ancestors FROM Giles_IsAncestor_Facts WHERE Descendant = 'Marvin';
    
    Ancestors
    ---------
    Betsy
    Rob
    Julie
    Bob
    Ann
    Jim

  This selection statement is also available in the output.sql file that can
  be read directly by sqlite.
