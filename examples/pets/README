OVERVIEW

  This example illustrates a simple production system that infers that an
  animal living in the same domicile as a human is a pet of that human.

COMPILING THE ENGINE

  After installing Giles, this engine can be compiled using the following
  command:

    $ giles -o pets.sql pets.yml

LOADING THE ENGINE

  The engine can be loaded into a SQLite instance with the following commands:

    $ sqlite3
    sqlite> PRAGMA recursive_triggers = ON; /* If necessary. */
    sqlite> PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON; /* If necessary. */
    sqlite> .read pets.sql

USING THE ENGINE

  This engine describes four classes of facts.

  Each known person has a fact asserting his or her existence (the Age field
  is not used in this engine, but appears as an illustrative example to show
  that not all fields need to be used in a rule):

    INSERT INTO Giles_PersonExists_Facts(Name, Age) VALUES('Rob', 34);
    INSERT INTO Giles_PersonExists_Facts(Name, Age) VALUES('Joel', 30);

  Each animal likewise has a fact asserting his or her existence (the Age
  field is again not used):

    INSERT INTO Giles_AnimalExists_Facts(Name, Age) VALUES('Caboose', 6);
    INSERT INTO Giles_AnimalExists_Facts(Name, Age) VALUES('Donut', 11);
    INSERT INTO Giles_AnimalExists_Facts(Name, Age) VALUES('Vanna', 12);
    INSERT INTO Giles_AnimalExists_Facts(Name, Age) VALUES('Leo', 7);
    INSERT INTO Giles_AnimalExists_Facts(Name, Age) VALUES('June', 2);
    INSERT INTO Giles_AnimalExists_Facts(Name, Age) VALUES('Franny', 8);

  Each person or animal can be declared to live in some particular domicile:

    INSERT INTO Giles_Inhabits_Facts(Name, Domicile) VALUES('Rob', 'Chez Rob');
    INSERT INTO Giles_Inhabits_Facts(Name, Domicile) VALUES('Joel', 'Casa del Joel');
    INSERT INTO Giles_Inhabits_Facts(Name, Domicile) VALUES('Caboose', 'Chez Rob');
    INSERT INTO Giles_Inhabits_Facts(Name, Domicile) VALUES('Donut', 'Chez Rob');
    INSERT INTO Giles_Inhabits_Facts(Name, Domicile) VALUES('Vanna', 'Chez Rob');
    INSERT INTO Giles_Inhabits_Facts(Name, Domicile) VALUES('June', 'Casa del Joel');
    INSERT INTO Giles_Inhabits_Facts(Name, Domicile) VALUES('Leo', 'Casa del Joel');
    INSERT INTO Giles_Inhabits_Facts(Name, Domicile) VALUES('Franny', 'Casa del Joel');

  These statements are also available in the input.sql file that can be read
  directly by sqlite.

  The engine will automatically produce IsAPet facts for the animals that
  live with people:

    SELECT Person, Pet FROM Giles_IsAPet_Facts;
    Person      Pet       
    ----------  ----------
    Rob         Caboose   
    Rob         Donut     
    Rob         Vanna     
    Joel        June      
    Joel        Leo       
    Joel        Franny    

  This statement is also available in the output.sql file that can be read
  directly by sqlite.
